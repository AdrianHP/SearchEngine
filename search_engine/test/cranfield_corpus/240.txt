a theoretical analysis of heat transfer in regions of separated flow .
    the flow field analyzed consists of a thin, constant pressure
viscous mixing layer separated from a solid surface by an enclosed
region of low-velocity air (/dead air/) . the law of conservation of
energy is employed to relate calculated conditions within the
separated mixing layer to the rate of heat transfer at the solid
surface . this physical speed is app ied to alminar separations in
compressible flow for various prandtl numbers, including consideration
of the case where air is injected into the separated region  .
